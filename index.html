                        Syntax
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        The syntax of a programming language refers to its rules and structures. It defines how instructions and expressions should be written to form an efficient program. Syntax includes elements such as keywords, punctuation, and rules for organizing code.

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Semantics deals with the meaning of programming language constructs. It includes the behavior and interpretation of statements and expressions. Semantics define how instructions are executed and how they affect the state of the program.

                        Variables
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Variables are used to store and manipulate data in a program. They have a name, a type and a value. Programmers can assign values to variables and perform operations on them.
                    </p>

                        Data Types
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Data types define the types of data that can be stored and manipulated in a programming language. Common data types include integers, floating point numbers, characters, strings, Boolean values, and arrays. Some languages also support more complex data types such as structures, classes, and objects.

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Control structures allow programmers to control the flow of execution of a program. They include conditional statements (if-else, switch), loops (for, while, do-while), and branch statements (break, continue, return).
                    </p>

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Functions and procedures are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They encapsulate a set of instructions that can accept parameters and return values. Functions and procedures promote modularity and reusability of code.

                        Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects, which are instances of classes. It emphasizes concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. The OOP language provides mechanisms for creating classes, objects and defining their behavior.

                    <p>
                        Imperative programming focuses on how to achieve a result by specifying detailed steps and instructions. Declarative programming, on the other hand, focuses on what the program should accomplish without specifying how to achieve it. Examples of declarative programming paradigms include functional programming and logic programming.

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Programming languages can be compiled or interpreted. The compiled language is translated into machine code before execution, thereby improving performance. Interpreted languages are executed directly by an interpreter, which translates and executes the code line by line. Interpreted languages generally offer greater flexibility and easier debugging.

                    <p>
                        Libraries and frameworks provide pre-written code and functionality to simplify software development. Libraries are collections of reusable code modules, while frameworks provide the foundation and structure for building applications.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Definition:</strong> A programming language defines the syntax and semantics of a programming language. Syntax specifies how instructions and expressions should be written to form efficient programs. Syntax includes keywords, punctuation, and code organization rules.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>The purpose</strong> of a programming language is to enable programmers to communicate with computer systems and express their ideas. They provide a way to write executable instructions to implement specific computing tasks and operations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Abstraction:</strong> Programming languages simplify program development by providing various levels of abstraction. Abstraction can hide underlying complexity, allowing programmers to think and write code in terms of higher-level concepts and concepts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Automation:</strong> Programming languages provide the ability to automate the execution of instructions. Programmers can write a series of instructions and execute these instructions through the computer system to automatically complete specific calculations and operations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Readability:</strong> A good programming language should have good readability so that programmers can easily understand and maintain the code. Readability includes clear syntax, meaningful identifiers and comments, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Portability:</strong> Portability of a programming language refers to the ability to run the same program on different computers and operating systems. Portability is achieved by writing code that is independent of specific hardware and operating systems.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Extensibility:</strong> A programming language should be extensible so that programmers can add new features and modules as per requirement. Extensibility can be achieved through modular design, the concepts of functions and classes, and the use of libraries and frameworks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Ecosystem:</strong> Programming languages typically have a rich ecosystem of development tools, libraries, frameworks, and community support. These components provide additional resources and support to help programmers develop and maintain programs more efficiently.
